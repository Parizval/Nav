A product aimed at mitigating the effects of pollution in its various forms on the daily lives of people.

## Basic Definitions
**Pollution** is the contamination of the natural environment that causes adverse changes to it. 


**Visual Pollution** is an aesthetic issue and impairs ones ability to enjoy a vista or view.


**Sound Pollution** is the propogation of noise with an adverse impact on human and animal life.

## Objective
To develop a product prototype based on algorithmic methods to suggest routes based on:
  1. Air Quality Index
  2. Traffic
  3. Asthetics
  4. Safety
  5. Crowd

## Implemenetation
For a given set of paramenters: distance, level of priority of crowd, traffic and greenery (entered by user):
  1
  
  
  
## Features
 
    1)  Best route on the basis of AQI:
        The app picks out the best route that a user can take during an outdoor workout: cycling,
        walking or running on the basis of the AQI of the points on the route.
     
     2) Choice of priority of parameteres:
        The user can pick the priority of certain parameters to him/ her. He/ She can decide the
        level of priority of said paramteres in his/ her daily workout. On the basis of these choices
        the application picks the most suitable paths.
        
         
     3)  Path improvement:
         On the basis of user feedback, our algorithm improves the route to be taken.
         
     4) Comparison of Routes:
        The user is able to see the top five best routes that match his requirements parameters. He can 
        then compare the differences in AQI and other paramenters our suggested route and the other 
        possible routes. 
        
     5) Forcast:
